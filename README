dis is how it is
we got like:

cell.py - defines the collision grid which the map is divided into, as well as
	a few functions for adding and deleting cells, and finding objects in cells.
	before any entities are instantiated, the Grid class should be instantiated
	once. they will automatically be placed in the appropriate cells based on their
	position and size. don't spawn Grid objects twice, or the existing grid will be 
	overwritten

collision.py - defines the generic polygon-polygon collision detection routine (_collide), 
	which with a little teaking should work independently of this stuff, as well as 
	the collision handling loop used specifically for the game

control.py - defines modes of behaviour for various entities, including human input.
	for AI, this will eventually contain long term behaviour and its short term
	implementation

definitions.py - well, self explanatory, but blah blah blah

entity.py - entities more or less just define and organize groups default values

ground.py - just the map height array, for now. but eventually everything will be more
	fleshed out

sprite.py - arrays for simulated pixel sprites

testgl.py - just sandboxing shit

texture.py - texture loading for entities. unused

vectors.py - vector related functions, blah blah blah
